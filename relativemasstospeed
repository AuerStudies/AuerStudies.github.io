<h1 style="text-align: center; padding-left: 90px;">Relative Mass to Speed</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;">In this article, I will show you how things get heavier the faster you go. I have an image to show you better about how much it increases the higher you go.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">As you can see above, any object will weigh more, and be harder to move further, the faster it goes. For example, a small baseball (142 grams) moving at the speed of an Oh-My-God-Particle would weigh around 1/4 of the NASA space shuttle. WOAH, that's a lot in a small baseball! The summary is that this doesn't really matter now because humans haven't reached such speeds yet, as even astronauts on a space station have a very small effect, as the effect gets larger as the object goes closer to the speed of light.</p>
